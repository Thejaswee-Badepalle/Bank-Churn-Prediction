# Bank Churn Prediction
Note: This repository was created as part of our Machine Learning course project in the Ai and Data Science program (PGWD) at Loyalist College in Toronto.
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using logistic regression and SVM models. The goal is to build, tune, and deploy these models, providing interpretability and insights into customer behavior. The project includes a comprehensive dataset analysis, model training, tuning, and deployment using Flask and Streamlit.
